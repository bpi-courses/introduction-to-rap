00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:06.000
So we've got trustworthiness the organisation's 
commitment to being honest and truthful

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:08.000
and reliable 

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:14.000
we've got quality which is about the data
themselves where they're from, how they're used, what they mean.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:20.000
But those two on their own and not enough for
people to have confidence in the statistics

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:24.000
Because the most important thing of all,
in some ways is that the statistics are valuable

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:27.000
That they have value
and what do we mean by that? 

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:32.000
Well it's not much good having a trustworthy
organisation producing quality

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:39.000
statistics on a subject that nobody's
really interested in. When the questions

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:42.000
they really want to answer are something
else altogether

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:48.000
kind of being this role of the lifeblood
of democratic debate that we think is so important

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:51.000
So under the value pillar which is in a
way the newest part of this code

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:56.000
the part that we're really
emphasizing as a fresh demand for

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:58.000
government statistics is this notion

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:02.000
that they must be valuable they must answer
people's questions that provide

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:07.000
insight they must meet users needs
they must be accessible this notion of

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:12.000
value is really essential and I think
that just with trustworthiness and

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:16.000
quality it runs the risk of having
statistics as being a series of

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:20.000
quite dry numbers existing in a rather
abstract technical world not very human

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:24.000
not very meaningful the value pillar is
the one which humanises the whole piece

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:32.000
quite dry numbers existing in a rather
abstract technical world not very human

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:45.000
