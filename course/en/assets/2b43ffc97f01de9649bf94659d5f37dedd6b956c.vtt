What it is to command confidence is
not just about the numbers themselves 

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:11.000
to be confident in somebody or someone or an
organisation you need to understand their context.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:16.000
In any situation it's not
just the thing itself but it's who's

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:21.000
saying it and your sense of their motives.
So we start with this human understanding of

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:26.000
what is it that creates
confidence and that begins with context.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:29.000
We call that Trustworthiness, 

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:33.000
we call that a really core thing that anybody
publishing statistics needs to do is

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:40.000
demonstrate that they are trustworthy they are worthy
of trust and in our code that's our starting point.

00:40.000 --> 00:46.000
It's our first pillar of Trustworthiness
and we create around it a set of commitments

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:48.000
 that organisations can make,

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:50.000
they can make publicly, to demonstrate

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:54.000
that they're worthy of trust. 
These are really kind of meaningful commitments

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:58.000
that they make themselves accountable to
live up to. Really simple things often

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:04.000
things like there will be a Head of
Profession for statistics, a named person

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:08.000
who is responsible that organisations
statistical output or an even simpler thing.

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:13.000
That the organisation will commit
to publishing its statistics on a particular day

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:19.000
at a particular time, in advance, 
and come what may they will meet that commitment. 

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:23.000
There's a whole range of other commitments
they all underpin this organisation being worthy of trust

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:30.000
demonstrating that it is something or an
organisation that people can have confidence in.
